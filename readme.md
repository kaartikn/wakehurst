## Trading Engine in Java

I developed a **Multithreaded Trading Engine** which is designed to handle trading operations with efficiency and precision. The engine employs a Pro-Rata matching algorithm and error logging.

## Options Pricing Model in C++

Another key project of mine is the **Options Pricing Model**, which employs a Monte Carlo Simulation to capture the underlying logic of the Black-Scholes formula. This model is adept at simulating various market scenarios and accurately pricing options contracts, offering invaluable insights into risk assessment and strategy formulation in complex financial markets.
